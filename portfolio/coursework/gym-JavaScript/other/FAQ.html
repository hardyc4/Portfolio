1.	What is BMI?
	BMI is an acronym for Body Mass Index, and it is an indicator 
	of the amount of fat which is stored in the human body. It 
	provides a measure of the appropriateness of your weight to 
	your height, based on health issues which are known to arise
	as a result of having a BMI which is too low or too high.
	

2.	Who invented BMI?		
	The BMI formula and its name were invented by different people, 
	living in different centuries. The BMI formula was developed in 
	the 1830s by Adolphe Quetelet, a Belgian mathematician and social 
	statistician. He used his skills in calculus and statistics to 
	analyse the relationship between height and weight in populations, 
	and formulated what was known for 140 years as the Quetelet Index. 
	In 1972 the American biologist and physiologist Ancel Keys published 
	a paper endorsing the validity of the index, and in the process he 
	renamed it and popularised it as the Body Mass Index.

	
3.	Why is BMI important?
	BMI is important as it is able to predict, with considerable accuracy, 
	mortality and morbidity rates in populations. What this means is that 
	BMI is not only able to predict the rates at which people within a given 
	population or group will die and suffer disease, but it is able to 
	predict the incidence of the different types of diseases which occur in 
	the population and which cause those deaths. However, as Adolphe Quetelet 
	and Ancel Keys stressed, BMI's predictive 
	abilities apply to populations only, and not to individuals within it.

	
4.	How is BMI calculated?
	BMI is calculated using only the variables of weight and height. Your 
	BMI is equal to your weight in kilograms divided by your height in metres 
	squared. You can also calculate your BMI using imperial units, in which 
	case your BMI is equal to your weight in pounds divided by your height 
	in inches squared, multiplied by 703.

	
5.	When should BMI be used?
	The calculation of BMI can be used for males and non-pregnant females 
	between the ages of 18 and 65. Although BMI is calculated for children in 
	exactly the same way as for adults, the results are used in an entirely 
	different way and for that reason a standard BMI calculator should not be 
	used for those under the age of 18. Also, the physiology of elderly people 
	differs from other adults (due to factors such as muscle wasting and height 
	reduction), and consequently BMI calculations should not be made for that 
	group. BMI calculations are also unsuitable for those who have developed 
	significant amounts of muscle mass through physical exercise, as the 
	results will tend to indicate higher levels of body fat than is actually 
	the case.

	
6.	What are the major BMI classifications?
	•	BMI values less than 18.5 kg/m² are considered underweight.
	•	BMI values from 18.5 kg/m² to 24.9 kg/m² are healthy.
	•	Overweight is defined as a body mass index of 25.0 to less than 30.0 kg/m².
	•	Obesity is defined as a BMI of 30.0 kg/m² or greater.
	•	Extreme obesity is defined as a BMI of 40 kg/m² or greater.
