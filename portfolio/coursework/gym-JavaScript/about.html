        <p><br><br><br>A little overgrown on the seward side, but totlaly manageable. From there the trail stretches out and travels pretty fast into a big berm with a view out into the valley. This trail can be sandy during dry summer months and is best after rain, in the spring or fall. Two wheel drifting is likely if you have speed but are not riding the top few inches of the berms. Parking at the bottom is near mile 12 of Palmer Fishhook Road, while the top of the trailhead starts near mile 16 of Palmer Fishhook Road. The trail has good flow with some spicy sections. Large group of trees down on northern section of trail, between buckhorn and club gap.<br>
            Few sniper rocks on the trail. This is optional, but recommended way to test how prepared you are for the trail ahead. Rowdy little downhill/freeride track. Big downed tree near the end of Lower Black. Use some caution in the corners here. Small tree down between bottom of trail and bridge crossing. after the jump you will enter the trail between two trees (fairly close together).<br>
            Some wet/muddy creek crossings, but otherwise dry. If you continue, the trail ends at one of the lakes and continues lakeside until reaching the point where you began the trail The lake-side bit is fairly technical and very fun. Logs embedded in the trail have been installed to signal technical terrain. Lots of branches. Amazing views of Castle valley are afforded after 50 meters of riding. A super fun freeride trail starting with the Pinkbike drop, an impressive 12' by 12' drop followed non stop features with lots of speed and perfect flow. The exposed rock section near the bottom is a highlight of the trail giving the exposed granite slabs of Squamish a run for their money.<br>
            There will be some short dismount sections for most riders, but overall, the trail is fast and fun. Dirt was pretty good, not too mushy yet, but the leaves on the trail are wet and very slick, a few corners were like riding on ice. Out here you will find the most legal features including log rides, jumps and rock rolls in South Tahoe including the new jumps, berms, rollers and hips TAMBA and SBTS built in 2014. From here the trail narrows and skirts a rocky hillside. Great conditions today. From here the trail narrows and skirts a rocky hillside. Awesome with a couple really dry spots in corners.</p>
